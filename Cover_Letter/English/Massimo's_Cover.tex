% Body
During my tenure as a CTF Challenge Designer at \href{https://www.athackctf.com}{AtHackCTF}, I developed RFID-based Capture the Flag challenges to simulate real-world security scenarios.

In addition, my academic projects, such as creating an online Food Database System and a Teacher-Student Feedback Web Application, allowed me to refine my expertise in Python, JavaScript, and SQL while working with APIs and relational databases. These projects taught me to manage end-to-end software development, optimize system performance, and focus on user-centered design.

% Why This Company
What excites me most about \textbf{[\company]} is \textbf{[\companyDetails]}. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to \textbf{[\positionDetails]}, which aligns with my career goals.

% Closing
I am confident that my technical skills, academic achievements, and passion for software engineering make me a strong candidate for the \textbf{[\position]} role. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experiences align with the needs of your team. Please feel free to reach out to me at \href{tel:+15149445977}{\phone} or \href{mailto:\email}{\email}.
