{Software Implementation, Intern }
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=0pt]
    \item Spearheaded data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing of raw merchant data sets for the deployment of MEVWeb, a province-wide cloud-based SaaS platform mandated by Revenu Québec.
    \item Participated in end-to-end deployment of MEVWeb software remotely and on-site, including planning, testing, and installation.
    \item Supported hardware transitions by uninstalling legacy MEV devices and installing MEVWeb-compatible components such as printers and routers.
    \item Collaborated with project delivery, field services, and sales teams to ensure seamless coordination of deployments and merchant onboarding.
    \item Tested MEVWeb software builds and deployment packages, reporting bugs and verifying stability before production rollout.

{Challenge Designer and Developer, Permanent Part-time}
\vspace{-3mm}

\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=0pt]
    \item Designed a complex RFID-based Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge using a real ATM machine and MIFARE Classic cards, which communicated with the machine's reader to simulate a security environment.
    \item Developed three flags requiring participants to:
    
        \begin{itemize}[left=0.2in, itemsep=0pt]
            \vspace{-2mm}
            \item Extract the card’s PIN from memory by reverse-engineering the RFID data.
            \item Manipulate the card's balance data, allowing the participant to alter the funds stored on the card.
            \item Modify the card's UID to impersonate an admin and escalate privileges within the system.
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{-2mm}
    
    \item Implemented an interactive ATM interface, including buttons for navigation and a printer to issue flags upon successful completion of challenges.
    \item Facilitated the learning of hardware security, from memory manipulation to privilege escalation, within a real-world context.
    \item Prepared over 600 MIFARE Classic cards by writing custom data to each card and ensuring proper labeling and formatting for participant use.

\textbf{Market Predictability (Deep Learning Project)}
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=0pt, label=--]
    \item Designed and implemented a PyTorch LSTM-based trading model to learn daily market leverage allocations on the Hull Tactical Market Prediction dataset, achieving an adjusted Sharpe score of \textbf{1.94}, indicating strong risk-adjusted performance with nearly twice as much return per unit of risk.
    \item Led systematic hyperparameter optimization across sequence length, hidden dimensions, learning rate, and regularization, identifying an optimal configuration that produced a cumulative strategy return of \textbf{122.4\%} versus \textbf{116.7\%} for a market benchmark.
    \item Developed evaluation and visualization pipelines to analyze equity curves, drawdowns, and rolling risk metrics, observing an average rolling Sharpe of approximately \textbf{1.14} with a maximum drawdown of \textbf{-25.2\%}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Embedded Wireless Access Control System}
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=1pt, label=--]
    \item Designed a two-node embedded access control system using ESP32 with BLE and LoRa, implementing servo-based lock actuation, tamper detection via analog sensing, and a deterministic finite state machine (armed, alarm, 2FA, disarmed) in C++ using PlatformIO.
    \item Implemented application-layer AES-128 encrypted alert messaging over LoRa and a BLE-based two-factor challenge--response protocol for local disarm, alongside an authenticated admin console with lockout policy and simulated biometric verification.
    \item Integrated multi-sensor inputs (potentiometer door position, IR motion, touch-based biometric) with encrypted wireless alerts, real-time console monitoring, and modular firmware architecture supporting offline simulation and incremental security hardening.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Food Database System}
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=0pt, label=--]
    \item Developed an online nutritional database integrating APIs (FatSecret, TheMealDB) to provide detailed nutritional data, recipes, and dietary metadata.
    \item Cleaned and validated JSON data, storing in hybrid databases (PostgreSQL + MongoDB) with optimized queries, indexing, and aggregates.
    \item Automated data migration between SQL and NoSQL, improving retrieval efficiency with custom recipe-name generator for FatSecret API.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Linear Regression Model}
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}[left=0.15in, itemsep=0pt, label=--]
    \item Built a multiple regression model to analyze life expectancy factors (WHO dataset, 193 countries, 2000–2015).
    \item Applied backward elimination to reduce predictors from 20 to 6, achieving adjusted $R^2 = 0.77$ and predicting Canada’s 2013 life expectancy within 0.5 years of reported value.
    \item Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
